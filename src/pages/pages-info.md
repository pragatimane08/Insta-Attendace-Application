# Pages Folder

The `pages` folder contains all the **page components** that represent different routes or views in the application. Each file in this folder corresponds to a **distinct page** in the application, typically linked to a specific URL path.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each file inside the `pages` folder generally corresponds to a **single page** or route in your app. For example:

- `Home.jsx`: The homepage of the application.
- `Login.jsx`: The login page where users authenticate.
- `Dashboard.jsx`: The main dashboard after the user logs in.
- `Profile.jsx`: The profile page where users can view or update their profile.

### Example Structure:

pages/
├── Home.jsx
├── Login.jsx
├── Dashboard.jsx
└── Profile.jsx


## 🎯 Purpose

The `pages` folder is used to:
- Organize the **main views** or pages of the application.
- Map **routes** to specific components that render content for each page.
- Ensure each page is focused on rendering the content and handling specific logic for that route.

## ⚙️ Responsibilities

Each page:
- Represents a **complete view** or screen in the application, which may contain multiple smaller UI components from the `components` folder.
- Is typically linked to a specific **route** or URL path (e.g., `/home`, `/login`).
- Should not contain complex business logic, instead it delegates that responsibility to **services** or **hooks** for data fetching or side effects.
